🚀 **Sales Analysis & Forecasting Dashboard in Power BI**

I recently completed a comprehensive **Sales Analysis & Forecasting Dashboard** project using **Power BI**, leveraging the **Superstore Sales Dataset**. This project aimed to transform raw sales data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into business performance, customer behavior, and future trends.

📊 The dashboard focuses on key performance indicators across **2019 and 2020**, offering a clear view of **Sales and Profit trends** over time. I used data modeling and DAX to create meaningful measures, enabling easy comparison and identifying seasonal patterns and sales peaks.

🎯 **Key Insights Uncovered:**

* **Top-performing Categories & Sub-Categories:** Phones, Chairs, and Binders emerged as the most profitable.
* **Regional Analysis:** California leads in both sales and profit, helping identify high-performing regions for strategic focus.
* **Shipping Modes & Delivery Performance:** Detailed breakdown of shipping preferences and delivery times, aiding logistical decisions.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analysis of segments and payment modes provides a better understanding of consumer behavior.
* **15-Day Sales Forecasting:** Used time series forecasting to anticipate short-term demand, assisting in inventory and marketing planning.

📁 **Dataset Used:** Superstore Sales (in both Excel and CSV formats)
🛠️ **Tools & Skills Applied:** Power BI, Data Cleaning, Data Modeling, DAX, Time Series Forecasting

This project significantly enhanced my skills in **data visualization, business intelligence, and data storytelling**. It highlights the power of turning raw data into strategic insights that drive better decision-making. The dashboard is tailored to be user-friendly and interactive, ideal for business managers seeking quick, data-driven decisions.
